# Clock used for the IPT

## General Infos
Should be free (major) bugs,
The *cancel mistake* option should not be used during timeout
All keyboard shortcuts have been removed to avoid mistakes, feel free to modify the code to add them

## Usage
### Executables
Executable files are available Unix systems and Windows in the *executables* folder, be sure to copy the whole folder corresponding to your OS as the app needs the *data* folder

### Python
You can execute the python code to run the clock and, eventually, modify it.
Simply run *clock.py*

## Settings
In the *data* folder there are *states.csv* (for the states of the clock) and *img1.png* for the image on the side of the clock, feel free to modify theses files, simply do not change their names.

## Known issues
On MacOS the graphics of the clock controls are slightly laggy, though clicking on the clock panel fixes the graphical lag.
